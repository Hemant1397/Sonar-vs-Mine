# Sonar-vs-Mine
This project aims to classify sonar signals as either reflecting off a metal object (like a mine) or a rock.

# Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing:

- Loading the dataset and normalizing the values.
- Handling any missing or inconsistent data.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzing the signal characteristics and identifying patterns.

Visualizing data distributions using techniques like histograms and pair plots to understand the differences between sonar signals reflected off mines and rocks.

Model Selection:

- Applying machine learning models such as:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks
- Model Training:

Training the chosen models using the training dataset.

Tuning hyperparameters for better performance.

Evaluation:

Evaluating model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the test set.

Using confusion matrices to understand model performance for each class (Mine vs. Rock).

Prediction:

Predicting whether a sonar signal is reflecting from a mine or rock based on its attributes.

Result Analysis:

Comparing the models to identify which one performs best for classifying sonar signals.

This project demonstrates the application of classification algorithms to real-world data and provides insights into signal processing for object detection, potentially useful in fields like defense and underwater exploration.
